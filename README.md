# Credit Scoring

Credit scoring is the term used to describe the process of assigning a quantitative measure to a potential borrower as an estimate of how likely the default will happen in the future. Traditionally, creditors build credit scoring models using statistical techniques to analyze various information of previous borrowers in relation to their loan performance. Afterward, the model can be used to evaluate a potential borrower who applies for a loan by providing the similar information which has been used to build the model. The result is either a score which represents the creditworthiness of an applicant or a prediction of whether an applicant will default in the future.

## Tasks
- Defines a proxy variable that can be used to categorize users as high risk (bad) or low risk (good)
- Select observable features that are good predictors (have high correlation) of the default variable defined in 1)
- Develop a model that assigns risk probability for a new customer 
- Develop a model that assigns credit score from risk probability estimates
- Develop a model that predicts the optimal amount and duration of the loan
